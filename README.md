### Recreating parts of the game Destiny 2 in Unreal Engine 5 for learning/portfolio purposes.

The project uses original 3D models, textures and audio assets ripped from the game, everything else has been recreated in Unreal Engine using the gameplay ability system as the core gameplay framework.


### Video example of a raid encounter: [Crown of Sorrow boss encounter demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCIADd_qOoE)


(Currently only the C++ source code is availible in the repository and not the full project, If you would like a copy of the full project feel free to contact me (Cant upload the Content folder to github, too heavy even for free version of git-lfs))


3D models, Textures and Audio created by Bungie
